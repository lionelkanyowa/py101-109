# The `or` operator returns a truthy value if either or both of its operands are truthy, a falsy value if both operands are
# falsy. The `and` operator returns a truthy value if both of its operands are truthy, and a falsy value if wither operand is
# falsy. This works great until you need only one of two conditions to be truthy, the so-called exclusive or, also known as xor 
# (pronounced "ECKS-or").
